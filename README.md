Responsive WIT
==============

To start learning the VSO API, I want to make a simple responsive webpage that displays workitems from a VSO instance.

Get Started
===========

Everything here runs completely client-side. I observed occasional issues trying to literally run from the filesystem, though, so it's best if you can have this served by a local HTTP server.

If you have Python 3 on your machine, cd into the web/ directory and type `python -m http.server 8000`. For Python 2, I think the command is `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. Then you can hit the page at http://127.0.0.1:8000. I'm sure Ruby, node, and other environments have similar simple HTTP servers.
